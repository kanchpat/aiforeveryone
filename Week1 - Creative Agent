# 🚀 Marketing Maven Remix: AI Agent Design

This repository outlines the architectural improvements for a high-impact marketing agent. We’ve evolved the workflow from a simple text generator into a **high-end creative strategy engine**.

![Marketing Agent Workflow](workflow.png): 

> **The Vision:** To bridge the gap between "AI-generated text" and "Ready-to-launch creative strategy" through a multi-agent critique and visualization pipeline.

## 🛠️ 1. Enhanced User Input
To provide the AI with real "creative fuel," we've expanded the input layer. Context is the difference between generic and genius.

* **Target Audience:** Detailed demographics (e.g., *Gen Z techies, suburban parents*).
* **Brand Voice:** Curated "vibes" (e.g., *Minimalist, Bold, Playful, Luxury*).
* **The Problem:** The core pain point the product solves, ensuring the marketing is solution-oriented.

## 🧠 2. Multidimensional Node Logic
We've upgraded the linear pipeline to a multidimensional strategy engine:

| Current Node | The "Wow" Upgrade |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generate Marketing Content** | Generates platform-specific **hook-driven copy** (e.g., TikTok Scripts vs. LinkedIn Strategy). |
| **Generate Vision Board Ideas** | Performs a **Competitive Gap Analysis** explaining *why* these ideas will win. |
| **Generate Vision Board Images** | Uses stylized prompts: *"Cinematic lighting, 35mm grain, Vogue editorial style."* |
| **Render HTML Files** | **The Big Reveal:** Renders an interactive, scrollable **Brand Deck** or Landing Page. |

## ⚖️ 3. The "Expert Review" (Devil’s Advocate)
We introduced a **"The Devil’s Advocate"** node before the final output. 
* **The Function:** It identifies three major weaknesses or brand risks in the current strategy.
* **The Impact:** This creates a "Self-Correction" loop, making the final deliverable feel like it was vetted by a human strategist.

## 🎨 4. Premium Visual Flourishes
The final output (Rendered HTML) is designed to feel like a premium agency deliverable:
* **Color Palette:** Automated hex-code generation based on the brand's "vibe."
* **Social Mockups:** Copy is displayed inside simulated Instagram/X UI components.
* **Audio Snippets:** Text-to-speech generates a 15-second radio or podcast "ad spot."

## 🧪 Quick Test: "ZenTea" Example
To see this agent in action, use the following test case:
* **Product:** ZenTea (Sparkling Matcha)
* **Hook:** "Calm Focus" (8 hours of energy without the jitters).
* **Result:** A minimalist, high-end brand deck featuring editorial-style photography and a "Growth-Hacking" social strategy.
